# Netflix-Analysis-with-Python

This project explores trends in Netflix content, focusing on TV shows and movies from the 1990s. Using Python and visual analytics, I created a dashboard to uncover interesting patterns in genres, durations, production countries, and more.

## Tools & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Pandas – for data manipulation
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
4. Jupyter Notebook – for analysis and dashboard creation

## Insights Generated
1. TV Shows on Netflix Are Increasing Rapidly
   The number of TV shows released has grown steadily over the years, especially after 2015.
   A significant spike occurred around 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave people more time at home    and increased demand for entertainment content.
   

2. United States Dominates Movie Production
   Holywood leads by a wide margin, producing over 1,800 movies.
   India follows with over 850 Bollywood movies produced, while other countries contribute far less.
   

3. Action Is the Most Popular Genre of the 1990s
   Action tops the list with 48 titles, followed by Dramas and Comedies.
   Classic Movies and Children genres lag behind with only 15 titles each.


4. Frequent Cast Members Are Primarily Bollywood Actors
   Anupam Kher is the most frequent cast member in Netflix's 90s content, appearing in 41 titles.
   Other top names include Shah Rukh Khan, Om Puri, and Akshay Kumar, suggesting strong Indian content representation.


5. Action Movies Tend to Be Slightly Longer Than Dramas
   Median and spread of durations show Action movies are generally longer, though both genres have overlapping ranges.
   

6. Fluctuating Trends in Movie Durations Through the 1990s
   Action and Comedy movie durations varied year by year.
   Action movies were consistently longer, with peaks around 1993 and 1995, while Comedy movies remained shorter and more stable.
